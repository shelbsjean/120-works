#Section 50

This assignment was really fun. I find it so fascinating that simple codes
and changes within code can have cool effects on the outcome of the code.
I wish I could have come up with a more creative animation but my creativity
for this assignment was minimal. I do like how my animation turned out even though
it is pretty simple.

Again I was unable to get help or lend help for this assignment because I completed
it after the due date. I will get back on track this week and do my best to give
and receive help when necessary. I had the most trouble with the creating different
animations for the two objects.

I was so interested in all the possibilities that p5 has to offer. Each week has so
many cool new code that I always feel is so simple but creates amazing results.
Technology is seriously so amazing and underappreciated.
