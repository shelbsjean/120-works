#Section 50

["Hello World" sketch](https://shelbsjean.github.io/120-works/hw3/)
 This homework cycle I read all the material given on the course website to really get a good understanding of the p5 functions. The steps I took to complete this assignment where following along the website and tweaking the code to better understand it function.
I did not have any problems on this assignment it was all every well explained and laid out so I was able to keep up and get it done. I was sick this week so I was unable to post in the issue repo to help others with their assignment because I did mine last minute.
I am excited about this class because its using code to create visual images and art on the screen which I got a glimpse of this week and I am ready to see all the possibilities p5 code has to offer.
As I said above I was unable to help out my fellow classmates because I did my assignment last minute due to sickness.
