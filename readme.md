## This weeks progress


  1.  This homework cycle I did the following:
  - set up Github desktop
  - practiced my markup coding
  - connected my Github desktop to my online repo

  2.  The steps I took to complete this assignment was to first read through
  and walk through the class website. Next, I practiced my markup code so I got
  comfortable with the programs. Then finally I completed the assignment.

  3.  I found [this website](https://people.rit.edu/~jac3160/230/project1/repo.html)
  to be very helpful when I ran into issues. I didn't have very many issues this time
  around because I am not new to this program or format for assignments.

  4. I really enjoy learning all the commands that you can do in Github that
  can simplify things or preform actions with a few key words.
  Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
  5. I ran out of time and was unable to help any of my fellow classmates this week.
  I am still adjusting to the new school year and will get better at asking for and lending
  my help when needed.
