#Section 50

This weeks assignment challenged me. I had a tough time with the math and the
grid system. I had to do a lot of guess and check. The monster didn't come out
perfect but it did resemble my sketch. I was happy with my finished product and
the color composition I chose.

I did not reach out for help on this assignment because I completed it after
the due date and was determined to learn how to do it myself. I still need more
practice with concepts like rotate and the color picker program within atom, but
overall I feel comfortable with how to create shapes and colors within p5.

I am excited to see the other possibilities that p5 has to offer. This class
has me super excited but also is keeping me challenged and on my toes.
