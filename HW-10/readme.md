This assignment was a challenge for me. I tried about three different codes
to try and achieve the vision I had in my mind. After a couple hours of trying different
codes and looking to the issue board I decided to just take the piece of my code that was working
and adjust the example code to achieve a working sketch. I am happy that I was able to incorporate
my code into the example and figure out what parts to adjust to achieve new movement. I hope to one day be able
to build the code of my vision with little help from outside sources.
