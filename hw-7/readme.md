# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing
 The original code is that of a white ball moving across the window bouncing off the
 edges with a dark grey line following the ball and marking its path.
 When the image is clicked for the first time, the ball quickens and a trail of
 balls follows behind marking the path. When clicked after the initial click, the
 ball changes directions slightly. This is happening because of the if statements
 embedded in the code. These state that if clicked the code will change and
 follow a different condition. The first 8 lines state the global variable of the
 ball itself that will remain the starting point for the rest of the code.
 Line 12-14 describe the canvas size and background color. Line 19-34 describe the movement
 and draws the ball and explains what will happen if it hits an edge of the
 window. Line 36 - 39 explains what happens when the mouse is pressed which in turn
 changes the above if statements hence the change in style of path marking and
 the changing of the balls direction with a click of the mouse.



## How did you alter the sketch?
I altered the sketch by adding a color background when the mouse is held down. The
 background starts off white then turns green when the mouse is held down. Then the
 clicks after this lead the to ball stopping the current path markings and starting again.
