This assignment through me for a loop because at first I was unsure how math
would connect with coding to create a sketch. I had to read over the website multiple
times to wrap my head around the concept. I am proud with how my final sketch came out.
I love how the mouse can change the color of the background depending on the location. Also
the random pattern of my ball adds a nice moving element.
I did look at some of the issue comments for this week so that I could solve my issues. They were very helpful
and Im glad that resource is available to us.
