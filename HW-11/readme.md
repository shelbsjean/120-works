This assignment was a major challenge that I just couldn't wrap my head around.
I think the functionality possibilities are amazing and I had so many ideas
that I wanted to be able to accomplish but my coding knowledge was just lacking
and I spent hours trying to figure out how to make an original sketch and have it turn out
how I saw it in my mind. After much research and failed attempt I decided to alter the
example provided to help better my understanding of OOP. I felt like this would best help me learn by making
adjustments and understanding what I wanted to happen and knowing where to look in the code to make it happen.
