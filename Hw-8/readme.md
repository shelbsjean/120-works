The concept of my sketch is that of rain. I used the examples on
the course website as my inspiration to my loop. I wish I would have made
the ellipses look like rain drops by adding a triangle to the top of it but
ran out of time to do so. Over all I am happy with the final outcome of my sketch. I enjoyed
making this code and making adjustments to it and then seeing the change on the website.
I find coding so interesting in that a slight adjustment to the code can greatly effect the overall
look of the live sketch. I didn't really run into much trouble with this assignment just had more fun playing around
with the code.
